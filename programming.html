    This is a list of Programming Challenges taken from <a href="https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects/blob/master/README-scratch.md">Mega Project List</a>. The idea
    is to improve my programming skills as I go through these challenges. Each challenge, when finished, will be labelled with the programming language I used and the date of completion, and also a link to the code on Github will be provided when possible. Currently I am learning <span class="label label-info">PHP</span> so most of challenges will be done in that language, but I have plans to expand my programming knowledge and learn <span class="label label-info">Javascript</span> <span class="label label-info">Python</span> and <span class="label label-info">Ruby</span> down the road.

        <b>Caesar cipher -</b> Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.
