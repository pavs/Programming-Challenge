## Synopsis

My eternal hopeless attempt in trying to get serious about learning programming. There has been so many false and abandoned starts that its not even funny. I am kinda sad about it and now I am hoping to do something about it. In 2014, I made my best attempt to get serious about learning and gettng good at programming. This repository is result of that. I had to abandon it for whatever reason and now that I look back at the code I hardly recognize whats going on, mostly because it wasn't properly commented but also because I forgot most of the programming stuff I have painfully pushed myself to learn.

**Its list of challenges I am going to implement and learng programming in the process.** The list has been collected from Mega Project List. I might add more challenges in the future. I might add more challenges in the future but it will depend on how well I get at it or if I am still enjoying doing it.

## Motivation

Now I am trying to revive it. Here are the things I hoping to do initially to revive things:

- [ ] Clean up the index page listing all the project ideas
- [ ] Link the completed project pages directly to main index
- [ ] Comment / update the completed project page add some polish using bootstrap
- [ ] Comeplete all the projects with PHP (if possible)
- [ ] Start doing the same with javascript
- [ ] Last do it in Python

I am going t give myself specific time frame of expected comepletion of each of these project ideas. I haven't come up with any dates but hopefully by this week.


## Contributors

You can help me by improving the existing projects I have already completed byt suggesting better ways or more standard / secure / noble ways to do things. The projects that I didncomplete I would like to do them myself first. But I will take suggestions and help if offered.
